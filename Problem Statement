Traditional dam monitoring and control systems rely heavily on manual supervision and fixed threshold mechanisms, which often fail to respond effectively to sudden changes such as rapid water level rise, debris accumulation, or unauthorized human presence near dam structures. These limitations can lead to delayed decision-making, inefficient water management, and increased risk of flooding or infrastructure damage. To address this, an AI-enabled dam automation system using Arduino Uno and YOLOv5 is proposed, which combines sensor data with real-time computer vision to automatically detect critical conditions and control dam operations such as gate movement and alerts. This approach enhances operational efficiency, safety, and reliability by enabling intelligent, real-time, and autonomous dam management.
